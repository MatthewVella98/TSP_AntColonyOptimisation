# TSP_AntColonyOptimisation
Optimising the Travelling Salesman Problem using the Ant Colony Optimisation and Parallelism. 

### Requirements
  - Designing and implementing an ACO to solve symmetric TSP instances taken from TSPLIB library (A library of TSP instances that will be used as datasets). 
  - Evaluating the performance of both the ACO-based methods using at least four instance sizes (number of cities) of our choice for each method. The sizes should be chosen wisely so that our evalution makes sense. 

### Reporting
  - How ACO works & How this is applicable to TSP 
  - TSP problem using Genetic algorithms (encoding etc.) and compare the method to ACO. 
  - Description of how ACO was used to tackle this problem (parameters etc). 
  - Evaluation: Discussing results, strengths, weaknesses and limitations. Proper experimental procedure discussing: setup, expected outcomes, results and a good discussion.
